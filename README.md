# Massive-MIMO-PY

I Implemented of multi-cell massive MIMO downlink scenario with imperfect CSI in python for wireless communication researchers, including me :]

This code can provide insight into massive MIMO systems. Furthermore, it can contribute to building a deep reinforcement learning environment of a massive MIMO.

Also, I already validated my code compared with Emil Bjornson's Massive MIMO Book.

If you're starting out building a Massive MIMO environment for deep reinforcement learning, this code can provide significantly reduce wasted time developing your project.
