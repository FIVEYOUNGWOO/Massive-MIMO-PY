# Massive-MIMO-PY

I Implemented of multi-cell massive MIMO downlink scenario with imperfect CSI in python for wireless communication researchers, including me :]

This provided code can provide insight into massive MIMO systems. Furthermore, this code can contribute to building a deep reinforcement learning environment of a massive MIMO.

Also, I already validated my code compared with Emil Bjornson's Massive MIMO Book.

If you're starting out building a DRL-based Massive MIMO environment, I provide code that dramatically reduces the time wasted on developing projects.
